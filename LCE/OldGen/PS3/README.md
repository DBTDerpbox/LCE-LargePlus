# Playstation 3 Edition

These were saved in the `GAMEDATA` format! Make sure you know how to import them correctly in this format before proceeding!

**Notice:** Due to the GRF data and world data not being on par with each other, **You can not load these as battle maps**. I don't have the time to fix up the GRFs to work with these, but feel free to make a PR with the fixed GRFs if you want!
